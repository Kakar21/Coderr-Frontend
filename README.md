# Coderr Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Coderr project, a tech-focused freelance marketplace tool. This project (*frontend*) was provided as part of my professional development program and was not originally created by me. I have made only minor modifications to the original code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Frontend and Backend Projects**
   - Clone this frontend project.
   - Clone the backend project as well (find the backend [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Coderr-Backend)).

2. **Setup and Start the Backend**
   - Follow the instructions in the backend project's README (available [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Coderr-Backend/blob/main/README.md)) to set up and start the backend server.

3. **Start the Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` and run it with Live Server (e.g., in Visual Studio Code).
   - This will start the frontend, and it should connect to the backend if it's running correctly.

4. **Guest Login Setup**
   - To log in as a guest, click on "Sign up" and create two guest users: one as a **customer** and one as a **business**.
   - The guest login credentials for both users can be found in `shared/scripts/config.js` at the top of the file in the variable named `GUEST_LOGINS`.

5. **Set up Backend Endpoint**
   - Make sure to update the `STATIC_BASE_URL` and `API_BASE_URL` variables in `shared/scripts/config.js` to match your backend's URL endpoint.

### That's It!

You have successfully set up Coderr with a frontend and backend, running locally on your system. Feel free to make changes and use this project as a base for your own ideas. Enjoy!
